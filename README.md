Comparative Analysis on Predicting Heart Diseases using Machine Learning Algorithms
    The health care industry produces a huge amount of data. This data is not always made use 
to the full extent and is often underutilized. Using this huge amount of data, a disease can be 
detected, predicted or even cured. Using machine learning techniques, heart disease can be 
predicted. The medical data such as Blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes, cigarette smoked per 
day and so on is taken as input and then these features are modeled for prediction. Using machine 
learning algorithms we can predict the heart diseases. The algorithms like Naive Bayes, support 
vector machine and Random forest are used.
    The four classification algorithms are used for (a) perform diagnosis of heart diseases of a 
patient (b) the prediction of heart diseases and assists the doctors to identify them easily. Based on 
the diagnosis, the doctor can analyze the different risk factors, signs and symptoms from patients 
and experts. The accuracy of each model using algorithms is calculated. Then, the one with good 
accuracy is taken as the model for predicting heart disease.
